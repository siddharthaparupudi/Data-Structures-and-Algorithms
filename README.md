# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

a1 - Implemented Stack data structure and a program to calculate distance and position after a sequence of moves in linear time 

a2 - Implemented Heap data structure and wrote a program to calculate number of collisions in a system. This can also be used to calculate the digits of pi if system parameters are set appropriately 

a3 - Implemented a 2D Range tree and a search nearby function which runs queries and returns desired set of points in (O(log^2(n))) time 

a4 - Implemented Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm and also accomodated for wildcards in the string 

a5 - Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for ideal packet routing in a computer network
